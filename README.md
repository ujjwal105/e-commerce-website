# GRABIT

Welcome to the GRABIT e-commerce site! This E-commerce site is a full-featured online store that provides a seamless shopping experience for users while offering robust management features for administrators.

## About The Project

GRABIT is designed to offer a comprehensive shopping experience. Users can browse various product categories, add items to their cart, and proceed with a secure checkout. Administrators have dedicated functionalities to manage products and view inventory.

### Admin

The admin panel includes a navigation bar with two categories:

- **Add Product**: Allows administrators to add new products to the frontend using the backend.
- **List Product**: Displays a list of all products currently in stock.

Explore the admin functionality in more detail [here](https://e-commerce-website-admin-tau.vercel.app).

### Backend

The backend handles various functionalities including:

- Image uploading using Multer
- Product management with endpoints for adding, removing, and fetching products
- User authentication with JWT
- User registration and login
- Cart management with endpoints for adding, removing, and fetching cart data
- Endpoints for creating new collections and popular products in the women's section


### Frontend

The frontend includes several shop categories (Men, Women, and Kids), a cart page, and login/sign-up functionalities. It leverages the backend to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience.
